# Class Emotion Recognition System (ClassER)
ClassER is designed to complement existing student survey systems by providing more insight in classes, allowing educators to adjust their teaching strategies to cater and improve their students' learning experience. It captures students' facial expressions in classes at set intervals and analyses their emotional states.

## Technologies
Frontend
* Angular
* TypeScript
* SCSS

Backend
* Azure Functions
* .NET 5, C#
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure Cognitive Services (Face API)
* Azure Cosmos DB

## System Requirements
* Camera (Smartphone/Laptop)
* Internet connection

## Privacy
Registration is required to tie the data to your account. Option to delete your account and data is available within the system.

Unfortunately, there is no opting out of being analysed when the image is captured. However, to protect the privacy of students, the system will not save any images captured. If such guarantee is insufficient, the work-around is to avoid being within the camera's view.

Images are processed using Azure Cognitive Services (Face API) service. View [Azure's Privacy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/cognitive-services-compliance-and-privacy/).
